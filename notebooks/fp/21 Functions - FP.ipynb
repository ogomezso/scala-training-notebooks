    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first lecture on the functional programming section. This lecture introduces functions, clears the confusion around functions and methods (defs) and also introduces more advanced concepts around functions in Scala.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anatomy of a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In a functional programming language people like to work or get more out of functions. For example we might want to pass a function as a parameter or simply use a function like any other value. With this in mind, we'd like functions to be ordinary first-class elements in our programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cool, cool but how to we do that? Scala works on top of the JVM which was designed obviously for Java. The first class elements in Java are objects (where an object is an instance of some class). So how do we level-up functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally you would have perhaps a singleton object that would represent a function and you would pass around that function wherever it's required. In Java, a really simplified version could look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "interface Function<A, B> {\n",
    "    public B apply(A elem);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Double implements Function<Integer, Integer> {\n",
    "    public static final Double INSTANCE = new Double();\n",
    "    private Double() {}\n",
    "    public Integer apply(Integer elem) {\n",
    "        return elem * 2;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this (in Java at least) is that it doesn't really \"feel\" like a function when you call it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Main {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        Double double = Double.INSTANCE;\n",
    "        double.apply(2); // Not that natural, we'd like something like this: double(2)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately Scala has a nice way of solving this problem. Re-thinking our implementation in Scala, we would end up with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "object Double {\n",
    "  def apply(elem: Int): Int = elem * 2\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all you need to do because we're using singleton objects. And using it is quite simple as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "object Main extends App {\n",
    "  Double(2) // Feels more natural\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How is this possible? Remember apply? `apply` is the method that makes objects callable. So when an object has an apply method, the Scala compiler will automatically replace any calls of the form `instace(param)` with `instance.apply(param)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to the next point - functions in Scala are instances of objects which define an apply method. Their base trait actually looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "trait Function1[-A, +B] {\n",
    "  def apply(elem: A): B\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just ignore the variance (-, +) on types for now. We'll have an entire section dedicated to it later. There are predefined traits for functions with up to 22 parameters. That one looks quite ugly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "trait Function22[-T1, -T2, ..., -T22, +R] {\n",
    "  def apply(x1: T1, x2: T2, ..., x22: T22): R\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So bottom line here is that in Scala all functions are instances of `Function1`, ..., `Function22` traits. The compiler heavy-lifts what it founds as \"callable code\" into actual method calls of the apply method defined on your instances. Methods are just `def`s - every `def` defines a method. That's it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on to our first exercises, let us create a succ function that gives us the next consecutive integer of our argument:"

    "\n",
    "Function2[Int, Int, Int]\n",
    "(Int, Int) => Int\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And so on, you get the point here. You will use this syntax quite often. For example, we are building a client library that performs HTTP calls. If you think about a `RequestHandler`, it's actually just a function that receives an `HttpRequest` and returns an `HttpResponse`:\n",

    "### Anonymous Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we don't use this syntax too often. Instead, Scala allows you to define anonymous functions. They look like lambdas from any programming language in general - in fact, you'll often hear about anonymous lambdas which refer to the same thing.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Higher-Order Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, right now you're probably wondering: \"How does this help me? Why does it make sense to create instances of functions?\" No worries, your answer is what follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "With functions being instances of objects we could pass them on to other functions, as arguments. Or we could even return them as values. That's why we say that functions are first-class citizens in Scala - they are just like any other object instance. You can return them as results or pass them as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "All functions that receive another function as a parameter or that return functions as their results are said to be higher-order functions. You may not see it yet, but this is a very powerful tool.\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
