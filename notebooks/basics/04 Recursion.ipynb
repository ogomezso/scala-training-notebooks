    "* factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1), for all numbers greater than 1\n",

    "### Stack Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming there are two types of recursion: stack and tail recursion. We'll discuss stack recursion first. A function is said to be stack-recursive if the recursive call occurs first. It doesn't need to be literraly the first thing you do in the function, it only means that you perform the recursive call before using the value it produces to compute the result. This leads to a growing stack of function calls:\n",

    "In this case, we say that the recursive call occurs as the last call. You can think that the recursive call itself is the result or leads to a result without the need to keep track of each intermediary variable on the stack. Tail-recursivity is usually implemented with the help of an accumulator which keeps track of the (surprise) accumulated result. Try thinking of it as a variable used within a loop. Using an accumulator in our function would lead to the following code:"

With this, the compiler will issue an error if your function is not tail-recursive. Bear in mind the fact that tail-recursive functions are optimized by the compiler. Although this annotation doesn't optimize anything by itself, it's useful to trigger an error if you're changing a function that's tail-recursive.\n",
