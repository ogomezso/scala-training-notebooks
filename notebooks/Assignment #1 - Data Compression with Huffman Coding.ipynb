    "### Building the Huffman data  structures\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**. The text to encode is converted into pairs of (character, number of occurrences of that character). The idea of Huffman encoding is that more frequent characters will have shorter codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"BACADAEAFABBAAAGH\" = [{A|8}, {B|3}, {H|1}, {G|1}, {F|1}, {E|1}, {D|1}, {C|1}]\n",
    "    read {H|1} as \"H appears 1 times in the text\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**. These pairs are sorted in ascending order by the frequency of their characters and stored as Huffman \"nodes\" in a binary tree. The nodes are all leaves for now. We store all the nodes into this sorted list as a primitive priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "    result = [{H|1}, {G|1}, {F|1}, {E|1}, {D|1}, {C|1}, {B|3}, {A|8}]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**. The two pairs with the lowest frequency are extracted from the queue and combined into a higher level Huffman tree node as the pair (the combined set of the two nodes' characters, the sum of the two nodes' frequencies).\n",

    "                 {H|1}  {G|1} \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4**. Insert the new Huffman node into the queue and keep the sorted property of the queue. Remember, the sorting criterion is the ascending order of the Huffman nodes' frequencies.\n",
