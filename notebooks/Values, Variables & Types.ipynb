    "Welcome back to our first lesson of the real deal! This will is all about the basics explaining the values, variables and types in Scala. Those are primordial building blocks that allow us to work with Scala. At the end of the lesson, you will know what is a value or a variable and how to define one and you should be able to choose when to use one or the other. Finally you will know how to determine the type of a value / variable.\n",

For the next few paragraph we'll forget that types exist in Scala so we can better focus on values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Long story short we'll see in a moment that every value and variable in Scala has a type. If you're lazy (like me) and don't specify it, the compiler will infer it for you.

You will often here that less side-effects means easier reasoning - it's easier for developers to understand the code when side-effects are not used. A side-effect is even printing something to the console - that's the reason we can't actually get rid of side effects, as the program would have no meaning.\n",
